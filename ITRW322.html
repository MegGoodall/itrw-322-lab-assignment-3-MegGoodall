	<h1>Programming Sockets in Python</h1>

      <p>A socket is one element of a two-way communication</p>
      <p>link between two programs running on a network.</p>
      <p>A socket is bound to a port number so that the TCP layer</p>
      <p>can identify the application that data is destined to be sent to.</p>
